# Introduction

Alloy Me App is my second project developed within just 7 days as part of the backend Ironhack bootcamp module.

---

# Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application designed for learning chemistry. Upon creating an account and logging in, users gain access to a personal page containing some useful information about chemical elements and some alloys, and you will be able to test your knowledge and earn points by answering questions in the random test page.

If you have admin privileges you will be able to create, read, update and delete any user, alloy or test.
There is a testing account which you can try login with: test / test.
